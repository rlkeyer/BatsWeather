# BatsWeather

This application list of Louisville Bats baseball games with the date, time, opponent, and average high and low temperature from that specific date from the last three years.

The application performs the following:
1. Data is read in from two different CSV files
2. A new ArrayList is created merging the columns of the two datasets into one
3. New data is displayed to the console in a table
4. New data is saved to a new CSV file
